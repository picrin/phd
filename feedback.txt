
talk less about complex disease.
-omics (?) proteomics transcriptomics (!) (how much RNA per cell) metabolomics genomics microarray (what we do with the data)

individual specific effects.  

1) Single gene disorder (single mutation determine)
2) tandem repeat (sequence of the repeat varied)
3) other genes affect + environment
4) group of people with the disease (case/control).
5) RNA
6) residual
7) look elswhere effect?
8) Explaining is a challenge
9) Factour out STR, still effects visible.
   -- expression level changes.
   -- more genes relevant to MD
10) half accounting for the noise
11) why is noise there?
