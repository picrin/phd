1. What can my phd achieve (realistically)?
  -- Missing Inheritability and genetic cause of Complex Disease are arguably some of the biggest unsolved problem in genetics.
  -- Solving complex disease is unrealistic in course of a phd, a more narrow focus is needed.
  -- years of work on Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have generated a lotÄ‡ of data, but did not reveal much about diseases they studied!
  -- Understanding complex disease outgrew genetics. Areas involved are: medicine, statistics, computational biology, biochemistry, biotechnology, environmental science, any more more.
  -- A particularly good technique that allows to  vast amounts of data is machine learning.
  -- Futuristically one can imagine that patients will input their genomes to the NHS, and the NHS will assess their risk.


2. Why am I a good fit?
  -- past experience (research in bacterial membrane composition, level 4 project in genetics, extensive experience with programming, machine learning module @ University)
  -- interest
